# machine-learning-playground
A playground repository to explore Machine Learning algorithms and Data Science methods and tools. 

Although I already graduated with a B.A. in Data Science from U.C. Berkeley, I wanted to challenge myself to relearn ML Algorithms and build them from scratch using data sets from Kaggle. I was inspired to do this while taking Andrew Ng's ML courses on Coursera. As I complete a course, I would like to take a dataset from Kaggle and implement what I have learned.
