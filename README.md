# machine-learning-playground
A playground repository to explore Machine Learning algorithms and Data Science methods and tools. 

Although I already graduated with a B.A. in Data Science from U.C. Berkeley, I wanted to challenge myself to relearn ML Algorithms and build them from scratch using data sets from Scikit-learn and/or Kaggle. I was inspired to do this while taking Andrew Ng's ML courses on Coursera. As I complete a course, I would like to take a dataset from SKLearn or Kaggle and implement what I have learned.

## Supervised Learning
### Regression
- Simple Univariate Linear Regression

  This project explores basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a simple Kaggle dataset and to build a simple linear regression model that implements gradient descent. I also compared the model to Scikit-learn's LinearRegression model.

- Multiple Linear Regression

  This project uses a toy dataset from Scikit-learn that is used to predict the quantitative measure of diabetes. A linear regression model is built that implements gradient descent. Basic hyper-parameter tuning is done with a validation set. A runtime comparaison is explored using non-matrix operations and Numpy's matrix operations. Also, results are compared with Scikit-learn's SGDRegressor using a test set.

## Classification
- Binary Digits Logistic Regression
  
  This project uses a toy dataset from Scikit-learn that is used to predict digits from 0-9. This project only uses digits 0 and 1 for binary classification using a  logistic regression model created with Python and the Numpy library. Basic hyper-parameter tuning is done using a validation set. I compare the model's results with Scikit-learn's LogisticRegression model with a test set.
